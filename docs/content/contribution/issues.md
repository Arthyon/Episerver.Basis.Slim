# Reporting Bugs and Suggestions

Use Github issues to report bugs and suggestions.

Remember to mark the issue with the correct label:

Type of issue should be labeled with either bug, question or suggestion.

Which part of the project the issue pertains to should be labeled using either:

* template - for issues regarding the template when scaffolding is completed
* generation - for issues regarding the build process, improvements to the scaffolding tool etc.
