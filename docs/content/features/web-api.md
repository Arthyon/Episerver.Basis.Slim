## Web Api

WebApiInitializer initializes the Web Api.

By default it enables attribute routing and camel case formatting to the returned json.

For more information about attribute routing, [read more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions/attribute-routing-in-web-api-2)

By convention, new api controllers should be put in the Api-folder.
