## How to contribute
There are four areas to contribute to: The template, the scaffolding tool, the documentation and opening issues for bugs or suggestions.

To start with either of them, fork the repository and then continue with either:

* [Enhancing the template](contribution/template.html)
* [Improving the scaffolding tool](contribution/tool.html)
* [Writing documentation](contribution/documentation.html)
* [Reporting bugs and suggestions](contribution/issues.html)

If your contribution requires a code change, open a pull request in the main repository (See source code on github in the right menu).
